*DISCRIPTION*: In this task, I utilized machine learning techniques to develop a model for classifying the species of iris flowers using the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. The objective of the task was to predict the species of an iris flower based on these features using a Decision Tree Classifier. The first step involved data preprocessing, where the dataset was loaded, and the input features (X) were separated from the target variable (y), which contains the species labels. Since the Iris dataset is already clean, it didn't require extensive data cleaning. After this, I split the data into training and testing sets, typically using an 80/20 split. This allowed me to train the decision tree model on a portion of the data while keeping another portion for testing the model's performance. For training, I used the Decision Tree Classifier from the scikit-learn library, an algorithm that works by recursively splitting the data based on feature values that best separate the classes. Each decision node in the tree represents a feature, and each branch indicates the decision rule based on a feature's value. The goal is to create splits that result in homogenous subsets, ideally leading to nodes where most of the data belongs to a single class. The depth of the tree, the minimum number of samples per leaf, and other hyperparameters were fine-tuned to prevent overfitting and ensure the model’s generalizability. Once the model was trained, I proceeded to visualize the decision tree. Visualizing a decision tree provides an intuitive way to understand how the model makes decisions. By using plot_tree from scikit-learn, I was able to generate a graphical representation of the tree. The visualization depicted the feature at each node, the threshold value that splits the data, and the resulting class at each leaf. Additionally, the Gini impurity index was displayed at each node, indicating how well the split separated the data. A lower Gini value means that the node is purer, with fewer misclassifications. This visual representation allowed me to see which features were the most important for classifying the iris species. For instance, petal length and petal width emerged as more influential features in determining the species compared to sepal length and width. Following the training and visualization, the model's performance was evaluated using the test dataset. I assessed the accuracy of the model, which showed how many predictions were correct out of all the test samples. Additionally, a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the model's performance in greater detail, showing how well the model classified each species and whether any biases were present towards one species over others. The results demonstrated that the decision tree model was able to classify the iris species with high accuracy. In conclusion, this task allowed me to apply machine learning algorithms, specifically the Decision Tree Classifier, to solve a classification problem. The visualization of the decision tree was particularly insightful, as it provided a transparent view of how the model made decisions based on the feature values. By training the model, visualizing the decision-making process, and evaluating its performance, I gained a deeper understanding of the decision tree algorithm and its application to real-world datasets like the Iris dataset. The task also highlighted the importance of selecting the right features and fine-tuning the model’s parameters to achieve optimal performance
